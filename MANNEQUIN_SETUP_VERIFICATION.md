# Mannequin Setup Verification Guide

## ‚úÖ MCP Commands Sent

The following configurations were automatically applied to your **BP_PlayerCharacter** via MCP:

### 1. **Skeletal Mesh Assignment**

Attempted to set mesh to:

- Primary: `/Game/Characters/Mannequins/Meshes/SKM_Manny` (male mannequin)
- Fallback: `/Game/Characters/Mannequins/Meshes/SKM_Quinn_Simple` (if available)

### 2. **Mesh Transform**

- **Location**: (X=0, Y=0, Z=-90)
- **Rotation**: (Pitch=0, Yaw=-90, Roll=0)

### 3. **Animation Blueprint**

- **AnimClass**: `/Game/Characters/Mannequins/Animations/ABP_Manny`

---

## üîç **How to Verify in Unreal Editor**

### Step 1: Check BP_PlayerCharacter

1. Open **Content Browser**
2. Navigate to **Content/Blueprints/**
3. Double-click **BP_PlayerCharacter** to open it
4. In the **Components** panel (left side), select **Mesh (Inherited)**
5. Look at the **Details** panel (right side):
   - **Skeletal Mesh**: Should show a mannequin mesh (SKM_Manny or similar)
   - **Anim Class**: Should show ABP_Manny or similar animation blueprint
   - **Location**: Should be (0, 0, -90)
   - **Rotation**: Should be (0, -90, 0)

### Step 2: Visual Preview

- In the BP_PlayerCharacter editor, look at the **Viewport** (center)
- You should see:
  - ‚úÖ A blue/gray humanoid mannequin mesh
  - ‚úÖ A spring arm with camera attached above
  - ‚úÖ The mannequin properly oriented (facing forward)

### Step 3: Check Content Browser for Third Person Assets

Navigate to **Content Browser** and look for these folders:

- `Content/Characters/` or `Content/ThirdPerson/`
- Inside, you should see:
  - **Meshes/** folder with SKM_Manny, SKM_Quinn, etc.
  - **Animations/** folder with ABP_Manny, walk/run animations
  - **Materials/** folder

## üõ†Ô∏è **Manual Fix (If MCP Auto-Config Didn't Work)**

If the mesh didn't auto-assign, do this manually:

1. **Open BP_PlayerCharacter**
2. **Select Mesh component** in Components panel
3. In Details panel:
   - **Skeletal Mesh**: Click dropdown ‚Üí Search "Manny" or "Mannequin" ‚Üí Select one
   - **Anim Class**: Click dropdown ‚Üí Search "ABP" ‚Üí Select animation blueprint
   - **Transform ‚Üí Location**: Set Z to -90
   - **Transform ‚Üí Rotation**: Set Yaw to -90
4. **Compile** and **Save**

---

## üéÆ **Alternative: Use Quinn (Female) Mannequin**

If you prefer the female mannequin:

1. Set **Skeletal Mesh** to: `SKM_Quinn` or `SKM_Quinn_Simple`
2. Set **Anim Class** to: `ABP_Quinn`
3. Keep same transform settings

---

## üìã **Common Asset Paths**

Depending on which content pack you added, assets might be at:

### UE5 Third Person Template:

- **Meshes**: `/Game/Characters/Mannequins/Meshes/`
- **Animations**: `/Game/Characters/Mannequins/Animations/`
- **Materials**: `/Game/Characters/Mannequins/Materials/`

### Alternative Paths:

- `/Game/ThirdPerson/Meshes/`
- `/Game/Content/Mannequin/`

---

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

You'll know it worked when:

- ‚úÖ BP_PlayerCharacter shows a visible mannequin in the viewport
- ‚úÖ The character is standing upright (not lying down)
- ‚úÖ Compiling the Blueprint shows no errors
- ‚úÖ Playing in editor (PIE) spawns a visible character

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### Problem: No mannequin visible in Blueprint viewport

**Solution**: Manually assign skeletal mesh from dropdown

### Problem: Character is lying down/rotated wrong

**Solution**: Set Mesh Rotation Yaw to -90 degrees

### Problem: Character not animating in-game

**Solution**: Assign Animation Blueprint (ABP_Manny/Quinn) to Anim Class

### Problem: Can't find mannequin assets

**Solution**:

- Check if content pack actually installed (look in Content Browser)
- Try adding content pack again via **Content Browser ‚Üí Add ‚Üí Add Feature or Content Pack**
- Alternative: Use migration method from a temporary Third Person project

---

## üì∏ **What You Should See**

After successful setup:

- **Blueprint Viewport**: Blue/gray humanoid mannequin with camera boom
- **Details Panel**: Skeletal mesh assigned, animation blueprint assigned
- **In-Game (PIE)**: Animated character that responds to WASD input
